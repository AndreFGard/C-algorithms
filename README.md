# Learning C algorithms

This repo contains some algorithm implementations in C written for fun and to learn more about algorithms as a whole and C. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
Find-c's spiritual successor is [indexer.cpp](https://github.com/andrefgard/indexer]
## Algorithm list
Keep in mind that I decided to focus my algorithms wise efforts in my [algorithms repo](https://github.com/andrefgard/algorithms) rather than here, so this is very incomplete.

## Notes

- Remove every "//DEBUG" occurence if you dont understand some part of the code and every step will be outputted by printfs 
- Vestiges of debugging can be found, such as needlessly initializing array elements

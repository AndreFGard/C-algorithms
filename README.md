# Learning C algorithms

This repo contains some algorithm implementations in C written for fun and to learn more about algorithms as a whole and C. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## Algorithm list

- [Mergesort.c](merge-sort.c): C Implementation of the mergesort algorithm.[ About](docs/mergesort.md)

## Notes

- Remove every "//DEBUG" occurence if you dont understand some part of the code and every step will be outputted by printfs 
- Vestiges of debugging can be found, such as needlessly initializing array elements
